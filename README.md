# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

HTML Structure:

The page includes a header, a 3x3 grid for the game, and buttons for resetting the game and starting a new one.
The msg-container is used to display messages like the winner or if the game is a draw.
CSS Styling:

The game has a clean, centered layout with a background color and responsive design for the game grid.
The .box elements represent the game cells, styled to have a distinct appearance with rounded corners and a shadow.
Buttons and messages are styled to match the theme and enhance user interaction.
JavaScript Functionality:

The game logic handles player turns, checks for winners or draws, and manages the game state.
It uses event listeners to update the game board when cells are clicked, checks for winning patterns, and shows messages when the game ends.
The resetGame function allows for restarting the game or starting a new one, re-enabling the cells and hiding messages.
In summary, this project demonstrates basic game development skills, including handling user interactions, implementing game logic, and creating a visually appealing interface.
